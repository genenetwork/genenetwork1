<STRONG>2018-12-19: BXD Genotypes file status (December 2018)</STRONG>
<p>
In September and October 2016, Robert Williams, Jesse Ingels, Lu Lu, and Danny Arends  released new genotype files for many of the original BXD strains (BXD1 through BXD102), and for all of the new strains (BXD104 to BXD220). Genotypes were generated at about 74,000 SNPs using the GigaMUGA array developed by Drs. Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena (University of North Carolina) and Gary Churchill (The Jackson Laboratory). Genotypes were generated at GeneSeek (Neogen Inc) with financial support from the University of Tennessee Center for Integrative and Translational Genomics. 
<p>
<strong>Update </strong>The new genotypes are now available in GeneNetwork as the <a href="http://genenetwork.org/webqtl/main.py?FormID=sharinginfo&GN_AccessionId=600" target="_blank">2019 Genotype file</a>. All SNPs were mapped to the older July 2007 mm9 NCBI Build 37 assembly and to the newer Dec 2011, mm10, GRCm38 assembly. Of the 74,000 GigaMUGA and many other markers we have typed, only about 6800 are useful (informative) in defining recombination events in the current set of BXDs. These informative markers either define unique recombination patterns across the 198 BXD strains (including extinct strains) or they define the proximal and distal ends of regions that do not contain any known recombinations in the BXD family.
<p>
This file provides consensus genotypes for 198 BXD strains and for the two progenitor strains and the reciprocal F1s. Of the 198 BXD strains, 191 are independent, whereas 7 are substrains (e.g., BXD48 and BXD48a). This file provides approximate locations of 10300 recombinations, an average of 52 per strain. Genotypes were generated using Affymetrix, MUGA, MegaMUGA, and GigaMUGA Illumina platforms. Microsatellites and eQTL genotypes were generated by the Williams/Lu laboratory. Unknown genotypes were imputed as B or D, or were called as H (heterozygous) if the genotype was uncertain. Genotypes were manually curated by RW Williams. Genotypes were smoothed to remove unlikely recombination events. Almost all recombinations are supported by multiple markers, although only one or two representative markers may be provided in this file. The original parent file (BXD_El_Grande_Master_Used_to_Proof_Final_Genotypes_2016.xlxs) contains data for approximately 37000 markers. A subset of the most informative 7300 markers are included here. Genotypes for Chr Y and  Chr M are provisional.
<p>
The file does not include any markers for Chr Y or the mitochondrion. 
<p>
As of December 2018 GeneNetwork uses mm10 coordinates for mapping functions.

<STRONG>2018-09-12: GeneNetwork 1 will be supported in 2018 but GeneNetwork 2 will become the main production server </STRONG>

<P>
<a href="http://gn1.genenetwork.org" target="_blank">GeneNetwork 2</a> is ready for testing and research projects. GeneNetwork 1 (GN1) and GeneNetwork 2 (GN2) share the a single database, but they use different code and algorithms for mapping and data analysis. There are some benefits of using GN2, including more powerful linear mixed model mapping methods that account for kinship structure. 

<P>The interface of GN2 is still a work in progress. Please send any suggestion, requests, or bug reports to rwilliams@uthsc.edu.

<STRONG>2016-10-02: BXD Genotypes file status (October 2016)</STRONG>
<p>
In September and October 2016, Robert Williams, Jesse Ingels, Lu Lu, and Danny Arends  released new genotype files for many of the original BXD strains (BXD1 through BXD102), and for all of the new strains (BXD104 to BXD220). Genotypes were generated at about 74,000 SNPs using the GigaMUGA array developed by Drs. Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena (University of North Carolina) and Gary Churchill (The Jackson Laboratory). Genotypes were generated at GeneSeek (Neogen Inc) with financial support from the University of Tennessee Center for Integrative and Translational Genomics. 
<p>
The new genotypes are now available in GeneNetwork as the <a href="http://genenetwork.org/webqtl/main.py?FormID=sharinginfo&GN_AccessionId=600" target="_blank">2017 Genotype file</a>. All SNPs were mapped to the older July 2007 mm9 NCBI Build 37 assembly and to the newer Dec 2011, mm10, GRCm38 assembly. Of the 74,000 GigaMUGA and many other markers we have typed, only about 6800 are useful (informative) in defining recombination events in the current set of BXDs. These informative markers either define unique recombination patterns across the 198 BXD strains (including extinct strains) or they define the proximal and distal ends of regions that do not contain any known recombinations in the BXD family.
<p>
The file does not include any markers for Chr Y or the mitochondrion. 
<p>
As of October 2016 GeneNetwork still uses mm9 coordinates for mapping functions.

<p>The BXD genetic reference population is a recombinant inbred panel descended from crosses between the C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2 (D2) strains of mice, which segregate for about 5 million sequence variants. Recently, some these variants have been established with effects on general metabolic phenotypes such as glucose response and bone strength. In this study, we examined both genetic variants across 40 strains of BXD and the two founder lines, in addition to a major environmental influence—long term feeding with chow diet (CD) or high fat diet (HFD)—to see how metabolic gene expression varies by genotype and environment, and gene-by-environment interactions. The basic heart phenotypes quantified in these cohorts were not affected by HFD feeding (e.g. blood pressure and heart rate). </p>

This is a preliminary release with known errors of a spleen gene expression data set generated by a DOD-funded consortium (Byrne, Kotb, Williams, and Lu). Please contact Lu Lu or Robert Williams regarding status of this data set.

Animals were generated at UTHSC by Lu Lu and colleagues. The spleen of untreated young adult mice was profiled using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST array that contains approximately 34,728 probe sets that target approximately 29,000 well defined transcripts (RefSeq mRNA isoforms) and essentially all known protein coding genes in mouse. This array is an "exon style" array with multiple probes in all known exons of each gene (an average of about 27 per gene) and is an abridged version of the Affymetrix Exon 1.0 ST array. However, it also does contain some probes that target non-coding RNAs and even miRNA precursors (search "ncrna").This dataset is now public, please contact <a href="mailto:rwilliams@uthsc.edu"> Robert Williams</a> University of Tennessee Health Science Center for further information.

<STRONG>2014-03-07: The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)</STRONG>  is providing a comprehensive atlas of gene expression and regulation across multiple human tissues.  The latest GTEx data release (dbGaP release phs000424.v4.p1) is now available on <a href="http://gn1.genenetwork.org/webqtl/main.py?FormID=sharinginfo&GN_AccessionId=545" target=_blank">GeneNetwork</a>.
<p>The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project is a collaborative effort that aims to identify correlations between genotype and tissue-specific gene expression levels that will help identify regions of the genome that influence whether and how much a gene is expressed. GTEx is funded through the Common Fund, and managed by the NIH Office of the Director in partnership with the National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institute of Mental Health, the National Cancer Institute, the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the National Library of Medicine, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, all part of NIH. This series of 837 samples represents multiple tissues collected from 102 GTEX donors and 1 control cell line. In total, 30 tissue sites are represented including Adipose, Artery, Heart, Lung, Whole Blood, Muscle, Skin, and 11 brain subregions. RNA-seq expression data, robust clinical data, pathological annotations, and genotypes are also available for these samples from dbGaP (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000424.v2.p1" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000424.v2.p1</a>) and the GTEx portal (<a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gtex" target="_blank">www.broadinstitute.org/gtex</a>). While GTEx is no longer generating Affymetrix expression data, donor enrollment continues and is expected to reach 1,000 by the end of 2015. Updates to the GTEx data in dbGaP and the GTEx Portal will be made periodically. contributor: GTEx Laboratory, Data Analysis, and Coordinating Center (LDACC) contributor: The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (LDACC PIs: Kristin Ardlie and Gaddy Getz).</p>

<OL>

<LI> 437 expression data sets for all species. Many of these are "variants on a theme" such as Male, Female, Combined, or PDNN, RMA, MAS5 transformations. 

<LI>240 expression data sets for the BXD family of mice The redundancy rate is probably about 3x (three versions of every primary data set). 

<LI>13.7 million mRNA traits. Again, figure about 3x redundancy. That is ~4 million molecular assays across the family.

<LI>685 million mRNA strain-phenotype values for the BXD family. That means that we 50 strains on average per trait (685/13.7). For most of these we also have standard error terms, so we have over a billion data points for the BXD family.

		(Implemented by Sam Ockman and Zach Sloan)
	</li>
	<li>
		The correlation page has been mostly re-implemented. While the output is the same, all features re-implemented in GN2 have been almost entirely rewritten using much clearer business logic and a framework and templating language (Flask and Jinja2 respectively).
		(Implemented by Lei Yan and Zach Sloan)
	</li>
	<li>
		The marker regression function has been re-implemented using the PyLMM code written by Nick Furlotte. This code is much more robust than the code currently used in the marker regression function of GN1 and accounts for kinship between samples/strains.

This is Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) expression data that has been normalized using what we call a 2z+8 scale, without special correction for batch effects. The data for each strain was computed as the mean of four samples per strain. Expression values on a log2 scale range from 6.252 to 18.07 (11.83 units), a range of approximately 3600-fold. After taking the log2 of the original non-logged expression estimates, we convert data within an array to a z score. We then multiply the z score by 2. Finally, we add 8 units to ensure that no values are negative. The result is a scale with a mean of 8 units and a standard deviation of 2 units. A two-fold difference in expression is equivalent roughly to 1 unit on this scale.  (Implemented by <a href="http://www.uthsc.edu/neuroscience/faculty/E_Geisert.php" target="_blank">Eldon E.

<STRONG>2011-7-5: Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center/ Merck Research Laboratories</STRONG>. This study aims at identifying functional variation in the human genome (especially as it pertains to brain expressed RNAs) and elucidate its relationship to disease and drug response. The ~800 individuals in this dataset are composed of approximately 400 Alzheimers disease (AD) cases, 230 Huntington's Disease and 170 controls matched for age, gender, and post mortem interval (PMI).  The tissue specimens for this study were provided by Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center (HBTRC).<p>  
Three brain regions (cerebellum, visual cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) from the same individuals were profiled on a custom-made Agilent 44K microarray of 39,280 DNA probes uniquely targeting 37,585 known and predicted genes, including splice variants, miRNAs and high-confidence non-coding RNA sequences. The individuals were genotyped on two different platforms, the Illumina HumanHap650Y array and a custom Perlegen 300K array (a focused panel for detection of singleton SNPs). Clinical outcomes available include age at onset, age at death, Braak scores (AD), Vonsattel scores (HD), Regional brain enlargement/atrophy.<p>

<P>The current version is mainly meant for testing. The interface still needs work.We have a long list of improvements in the works, but please send us your ideas. To test drive the tissue correlation feature you currently need to enter a set of mouse GeneID numbers. For example <I><A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/11820">App</A></I> is  NCBI Enbrez Gene ID 11820.  <I><A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23821">Bace</A></I> is Gene ID 23821. If you enter these two numbers in the interface and then click your heels twice. You should get back a simple matrix of values that lists both Pearson and Spearman correlations based on a comparison of expression in 25 tissue types. Click on the correlation values and this will pop up two scatterplots (Pearson and Spearman types).

<P>At the same time, this tool provides expression estimates for both genes, where a value of 8 in the Pearson plot represents the mean across all tissues and each unit represents a two-fold difference (log2 expression; Spearman rank values are just that--rank out of 25). To access this new feature select <B>Search -> Tissue Correlation</B>.

<STRONG>2009-08-24: </STRONG><B><A HREF="http://faculty.chass.ncsu.edu/garson/PA765/partialr.htm">PARTIAL CORRELATIONS</A></B> have been implemented in GeneNetwork on the <A HREF="http://alexandria.uthsc.edu:85">beta test site</A> and will soon be move to our production site. You can now compute correlations between a "reference trait" and any other large set of traits while controlling for variability associated with up to three other factors. For example, it is possible to compute the correlation between the expression of the gene formin 2 (<I>Fmn2</I>) and all other 45,000 probe sets in the BXD hippocampus data set while controlling for the effects of the genotype at the location of the <I>Fmn2</I> gene itself. This is done by using the SNP rs6375522 that is located in <I>Fmn2</I>as a controlled cofactor. In this particular situation the partial correlation then provides you with a measure of the association between differences in formin 2 expression and all other transcripts in the absence of genetic variation in formin 2 itself. Partial correlations are a great way to study correlations between genes with control for sometimes unwanted sources of variability--linkage with neighboring genes being one important unwanted source. Partial correlations can also be used to remove effects of sex, age, batch effect, etc. Users can upload their own "correction" factors that can be used to calculate partial correlations.

Samples were laser-captured from cortical layer 3 (except the hippocampus) and run on the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 array. We renormalized the data to an average expression of 8 units on a log2 scale. Two versions of the data have been entered in GeneNetwork: one consisting of 157 of 161 arrays; the second consisting of what we regard as the best 102 arrays (those with mean correlations of better than 0.88 with all other arrays). Case IDs have the following code structure: Brain Region, GEO ID, Sex, Age, Disease Status. E119615M63N is a sample of the entorhinal cortex of case GSM119615, a male 63 year old normal case. The tissue codes are E = enorhinal cortex, H = hippocampus pyramidal layer, MT = medial temporal cortex, PC = porterior cingulate cortex, SP = supeior frontal cortex,  V = primary visual cortex. GeneNetwork does not allow sophisticated display of the data, but you can perform correlation analyses of any of the 56,000 probe sets. For example expression of the <I>APP</I> transcript is higher in the AD cases and correlates well with many other AD related genes. At least 7.5% of cases are assigned incorrectly by sex (see <A HREF="http://gn1.genenetwork.org/dbdoc/GSE5281_F_RMA0709.html" class="fs14"  target="_empty">INFO</A> file) (Implementation by Robert W.

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>2008-9-15: </STRONG><B>GN code improvement by cleaning up "namespace pollution"</B> Every GN python module used to import other module by "from SomeModule import *" so that the class, function and variable of the imported module can be used without the imported module name as prefix. Since one typical GN python module imports over ten modules, and GN python modules always import other GN python modules like chain (B import A, C import B, D import C ...), the namespace is seriously polluted. It not only makes the source code very difficult to read (for anything not defined in current module, programmer may have look up dozens of imported modules to find where it is defined), but also makes the dependency among modules unclear, so the change to one module always has "unpredictable" effects to other modules. As GN software keeps growing, the namespace pollution problem keeps building up and make it harder and harder to maintain the software and develop new features. A lot of effort has been made to change all GN python module to import module by "import SomeModule", and add the module's name as prefix to the the class, function and variable of the imported module (thousands of places). This work not only greatly improves the source code readability, but also make the dependency among GN python modules clear, hence much easier for maintenance and future development.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>2008-01-20: </STRONG>  GeneNetwork consists of a cluster of servers that have identical software code and identical databases. The creation of the individual servers (bundles) that are part of the GN cluster is quite complicated. Each bundle consists of an application stack (Linux CENT OS 5, MySQL 5.0, Apache HTTP server, Mod_Python, and many code libraries and scripts). Components of the bundles ideally work well regardless of the physical hardware and network configuration. We have now rewritten and annotated the GN code and reconfigured bundles to make them as independent as possible from their particular network situation. We refer to this effort as "de-hardcoding" or refactoring GN. GN bundles are now easy to be deployed with minimum manual work. The following tasks still need to be done: configuration of IP addresses, specification of absolute directory structure as DocumentRoot for Apache, recompilation of certain third-party Python libraries according to hardware infrastructure (i386 vs X64_86).(Implemented by Fan Zhang). The number of bundle servers has been increased to six.

SGO is a patented algorithm based on <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis"  class="fs14"  target="_empty"><I>latent semantic analysis</I></A> that provides a score of the terminological overlap between any two genes based on PubMed records and abstracts (M Berry, Kevin Heinrich, R Homayouni, and colleagues). These scores range from 0 to 1 (cosine similarity) and can be used like correlation coefficients, although all values are positive. GeneNetwork provides the Literature Correlations along with expression level correlations in most Correlation Table output pages. Roughly 5% of literature correlations have an r value greater than 0.6. The Literature Correlation covers roughly 75% of known genes in mouse, rat, and human.

<P>The new 2007 dataset covers 21,903 genes and was derived from a corpus consisting of 242,365 MEDLINE abstracts.  (The previous literature correlation dataset dated back to 2005 and was derived from a set of 108,367 abstracts covering 13,129 genes.) 

<P>We have also added a new <b>SGO Literature Correlation</b> feature to the <b>Trait Data and Analysis Form</b>.

To try this feature select one of the <B>Calculate:</B> SGO Literature Correlation options in the <B>Trait Correlations</B> part of the Trait Data and Analysis form. Normally GeneNetwork computes correlations based on expression and then provides the literature correlation as a secondary data type. This new feature reverses the situation; now the literature correlation is primary and the expression data are given as a secondary data type. This is a quick and powerful way to determine whether expression data support particular correlations extracted from the literature.

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>2007-04-25: </STRONG>GeneNetwork's <A HREF="http://gn1.genenetwork.org/CGIDoc.html" class="fs14" target="_empty">Scriptable Interface</A> is now being extended at the request of Dr. Graeme Wistow of the National Eye Institute NEIBank so that external users and bioinformatics site developers can directly access the "best" data for particular genes and transcripts from specific data sets. 

<P>For example, it is now possible to link directly to the <B>Basic Statistics</B> data page for the expression of the rhodopsin gene in the eyes of BXD mouse strains using a string that has this form:

<DIR>
"http://gn1.genenetwork.org/webqtl/main.py?FormID=showBest&gene=Rho&database=Eye_M2_0906_R" (no line break)
<BR>

<BR>where "gene=Rho" can be replaced by "refseq=NM_145383" to retrieve data using the RefSeq identifier (do not use the decimal point and digit that may follow, such as "refseq=NM_145383.1"), or can be replaced by "geneid=212541" to retrieve data using the Entrez Gene identifier. 

<BR><BR>Although not recommended, the string "&searchAlias=1" can be added at the end of the command to retrieve data using the alias of a proper gene symbol when the original does not work. Thus "gene=RP4" will resolve to "gene=Rho" only if you add "&searchAlias=1" at the end of the command.
</DIR>

<P>When a particular gene is associated with more than one probe or probe set, our code selects <B>the single probe or probe set</B> with the highest average expression in that particular data set. For example, there are four probe sets that traget different parts of rhodopsin mRNAs. Using the Affymetrix M430 2.0 array, probe set 1425172_at has the highest expression in the eyes of BXD strains (the probes target the last two exons and the proximal 3' UTR).

<P>To choose a particular data set one needs to know the appropriate code, such as Eye-M2_0906_R in the example above. These codes can currently be obtained from:

<DIR>
"http://gn1.genenetwork.org/webqtl/main.py?cmd=help&parse=machine"

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>2007-03-23: </STRONG>We have annotated Illumina's Sentrix Mouse-6 1.0 microarray BeadArray platform (see Mouse LXS Hippocampus data sets). We have added or corrected gene assignments, symbols, and gene descriptions for almost all of the 46,166 Illumina probes. We added many data types not provided by Illumina and the MEEBO consortium in their original annotation files (http://www.microarray.org/data/download/MEEBO_Data.txt), including updated Entrez Gene IDs, gene ontology categories, human orthologs, OMIM identifiers, and the precise locations of the 50-mer probe sequences on the most recent mouse genome assembly (Feb 2006, mm8). Some helpful metrics on this annotation: For 46166 probes on the Mouse 6 array platform (including control probes) we have identified 36687 NCBI Entrez Gene IDs; 26180 matched human Gene IDs; 23899 matched rat Gene IDs; 26882 NCBI HomoloGene IDs; and 12790 OMIM IDs. Position data for the 50-mer Illumina Mouse-6 array were BLAT aligned to the latest mouse genome assembly by Hongqiang Li. Many of the probes and alignments have been error-checked to a limited extent by RWW. Annotation is still continuing and we will be adding new data over the next several months.

This map shows a locus that modulates the expression of the <I>Cart</I> transcript (cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript) on distal Chr 10 in BXD mouse strains (brain tissue). The <B>Control Block</B>, top middle, permits users to customize the display and its resolution. Pink, blue, and beige horizontal bars above the map provide links to higher resolution maps (8x) or to the UCSC and ENSEMBL genome browsers. Statistical thresholds for linkage are marked by grey and pink horizontal lines and are based on 2,000 permutations. The Y-axis provides a scale for the plot of LRS or LOD scores that are plotted using a thicker blue line. The calculation of linkage statistics are based on a total of 147 useful markers that have been genotyped in all 89 BXD strains (The Wellcome-CTC Mouse Strain SNP database with added microsatellite markers). The far more digital look of the LRS function that traditional interval maps arises for the simple reason that locations of recombinations in this cross have been precisely defined and only a fewer regions exploit a true interval mapping approach (see News item of 2005-06-17 for additional detail). </SMALL></P>

<P><SMALL>The thinner red and green lines and the right Y-axis display the additive effect size; green for high alleles inherited from one parent (DBA/2J in this example), and red for high alleles from the other parent (C57BL/6J). The units are log2 expression differences where 0.2 is equivalent to a 2^0.2-fold difference. The large number of closely packed tick marks along the top of the map show locations of genes on Chr 10. Gene blocks are color coded by the average density of SNPs per gene using a rainbow color sequence with low density in the blue/green spectrum and high density in orange/red spectrum. The bright orange hash marks along the X-axis provide a graphic estimate of numbers of SNPs that are segregating in the BXD strains in any particular chromosomal region. A long interval from 30 Mb to 65 Mb is almost identical by descent between the two parental strains. </SMALL></P>

<P><SMALL>Many regions of these maps are responsive to a mouse click. For example, the name and size of any gene can be determined by simply placing the mouse cursor over its mark. The same applies to the significance thresholds and the SNP track.

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>2005-06-17: </STRONG><B>New High Density Mapping Algorithm</B> that exploits the Wellcome-CTC SNP data has been implemented for the BXD mouse genetic reference populations on both public and beta sites. In the case of the BXD panel (BXD1 through BXD100), the merged SNP and microsatellite maps are based on a total of 7636 informative markers that differ between the parental strains, C57BL/6J (B) and DBA/2J (D). The locations of these makers are known on the latest assembly of the mouse genome (Build 34, mm6). The median distance between markers in this subset is 178,831 bp. The mean distance is 324,493 bp. There are only 26 intervals between markers that are longer than 5 Mb. No interval is greater than 10 Mb except on Chr X. These long intervals are essentially monomorphic between the parental strains. 

<P>The new algorithm exploits a selected subset of 3795 markers that includes all markers with unique strain distribution patterns (<A HREF="http://gn1.genenetwork.org/glossary.html#SDP" target="_blank" class="fs14">SDP</A>), as well as pairs of markers (the most proximal and most distal markers) for SDPs represented by two or more markers. This BXD genotype data set can be downloaded by ftp at <A HREF="ftp://atlas.utmem.edu/public/BXD_WebQTL_Genotypes_June05.txt" target="_blank" class="fs14">ftp://atlas.utmem.edu/public/BXD_WebQTL_Genotypes_June05.txt</A>.

<P>The mapping algorithm is a mixture of simple marker regression, linear interpolation, and standard Haley-Knott interval mapping. If two adjacent markers have identical SDPs they will have identical linkage statistics, as will the entire interval between the markers (assuming complete and error-free haplotype data for all strains). On a physical map the <A HREF="http://gn1.genenetwork.org/glossary.html#LRS" target="_blank" class="fs14">LRS</A> and the <A HREF="http://gn1.genenetwork.org/glossary.html#additive" target="_blank" class="fs14">additive effect</A> values will therefore be constant over this interval. Between neighboring markers that are separated by 1 cM or more we use a conventional interval mapping method (Haley-Knott) combined with a Haldane estimate of genetic distance. When the interval is less than 1 cM we simply interpolate linearly based on a physical scale between the markers. The result of this <B>mixture mapping algorithm</B> is a map of the trait that has an unusal profile that is particular striking on a physical (Mb) scale, with many plateaus, abrupt linear transitions between plateaus, and a few regions with the standard graceful curves typical of interval maps.</P>

<P>The same procedure will soon be implemented for other mouse GRPs, including AXB/BXA, CXB, BXH, and AKXD.

<P>For users that would like reference access to the old set of genotypes, we will set up an Archive site with the May 2005 microsatellite markers and maps.

Until May 2005, all genetic maps of recombinant inbred strains of mice in WebQTL have relied heavily on a set of roughly 1500 microsatellite markers genotyped across all RI sets by the Informatics Center for Mouse Neurogenetics (Williams et al., 2001; Peirce, Lu et al, 2004). In collaboration with members of the CTC (Richard Mott, Jonathan Flint and colleagues), we have helped genotype a total of 480 strains using a panel of 13,377 SNPs. More than half of the SNPs are informative in most crosses. These SNPs have been combined with microsatellites to produce new consensus maps for BXD and other GRPs using the latest mouse genome assembly as a reference frame (Build 34 - mm6). In the case of the BXD GRP, a total of 88 strains were genotyped using the full set of SNPs of which 7482 are informative. The order of markers given in WebQTL is essentially the same as that given in Build 34. To reduce false positive errors when mapping using this ultradense map, we have eliminated most single genotypes that generate double-recombinant haplotypes. Double-recombinant haplotypes are most commonly produced by typing errors ("smoothed" genotypes).

<P>The first of these is the <B>Compare Correlates</B> tool. This function is available in Selection Windows. It is essentially a Venn diagram set tool. Instead of providing simple graphs, it provides lists of traits in different parts of a virtual Venn diagram. For example, to find traits that covary with Sonic Hedgehog, Indian Hedgehog, Desert Hedgehog, Patched1, and Gli3, you would select five key transcripts into a <B>Selections</B> window (use the "Add Selection" tool and then select a group of traits in the Selections window). Compare Correlates allows you to chose the target database to which the key traits will be correlated. Compare Correlates was designed by Elissa Chesler and Stephen Pitts. Code was written and optimized by Stephen Pitts. </P>

<P>The second new tool is <B>Network Graph</B>. This function displays a set of traits and their correlations in the form of a graph with nodes (traits) and lines (correlations). There are quite a few tunable parameters, including the correlation threshold used to draw (or not draw) a line between nodes. To use this new tool, you again need to have traits loaded into one of the Selections windows. Network Graph was designed by Elissa Chesler and Stephen Pitts.

This work was carried out by Yanhua Qu. The M430 data consists of 45,000 probe sets. Positions were obtained using a series of methods: Method 1. A BLAT analysis of the actual probe sequence using a 48-processor cluster (our thanks to Yan Cui). Roughly 90% of all probe sets were mapped using this method. If the probe sequence did not BLAT with a score above 99 AND an identity match of 100, then we used Method 2: We used the position of the probe set given in the <A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm5/database/UCSC" target="_blank" class="fs14"> affMOE430.txt.gz</A> data file. This method recovered position data for approximaely 5% of all probe sets. If Method 2 failed, then we used Method 3: We obtained the position given by <A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=moe430" target="_blank" class="fs14">Affymetrix</A> in the files called "MOE430A Annotations, CSV (6.3 Mb, 10/12/04)" and  "MOE430B Annotations, CSV (3.9 Mb, 10/12/04)". This method recovered positions on roughly 4%. As a last resort we used Method 4: We retained position data from mm4 or mm3 without interpolation. No position data would be found for 198 records and no chromosome could be found for 46 probe sets.  We estimate that 5 to 10% of position data are unreliable.
