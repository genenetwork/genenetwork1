MOUSE BXD: The University of Western Australia data sets (Thymus, Spleen, Peripheral Blood Leucocytes)

Status: Currently these are unpublished and private data source with usage restrictions.

Please contact Dr. Grant Morahan regarding access and use of these data.

<Blockquote>
Data that are accessible via GeneNetwork belong to several research groups listed below. Some of the data sets are still actively being generated and analyzed. The scientists who are generating these data have often agreed to remove password protection and let the research community view, share, and analyze data. Although they are willing and enthusiastic about sharing these data, they have not relinquished interest or ownership. If you are planning to use results and data extracted from GeneNetwork in publication, we request that you contact the data owners prior to submission.

<P><B>Status</B>: DEPRECATED, PUBLISHED, and OPEN data source, NO usage restrictions as of March 1, 2005. Even the most recent release of these data is now obsolete. We recommend using more recent Brain data sets from the University of Colorado Denver (Tabakoff and colleagues) or from INIA.

<P>The forebrain and midbrain expression data were generated using The William and Dorothy Dunavant Endowment to RWW and published in early 2005 (Chesler et al., 2005). Arrays were processed at <a href="http://www.genomeexplorations.com" target="_blank" class="fs14">Genome Explorations</A> (Divyen Patel) or by Dr. Tom Sutter and colleagues at the University of Memphis. Data are now available on the GeneNetwork simply by clicking on the Information Page associated with the many different versions (transforms). Please contact <A class="fs14" HREF="mailto:rwilliam@nb.utmem.edu">Rob Williams </A> if you have any questions on the use of these open data. We now consider these data to be somewhat archaic and of relatively poor quality compared to recent data sets such as the INIA BXD brain data and the UCHSC BXD brain data.

<P> The barley expression data sets were funded by the BBSRC grant SCR/910/04 to Michael Kearsey (University of Birmingham, UK) and Robbie Waugh (SCRI, UK). Tissue and RNA isolation was performed by Arnis Druka at SCRI. Arrays were processed by Roger Wise (Iowa State University). Genetic linkage map was assembled by Arnis Druka by integrating updated RFLP-based mapping data provided by Andris Kleinhofs (Washington State University, Pullman) with SNP genotyping data (based on pilot barley OPA1) provided by Timothy Close (University of California, Riverside).

  <P> All microsatellite and SNP marker genotype data files for mouse genetic reference populations (AXB/BXA, BXD, LXS, CXB, BXH) are public. Genotype files for the B6D2F2 and B6BTBRF2 are public. The rat HXB/BXH genotypes are public. BayxSha Arabidopsis genotype files are also public. Any of the genotype files is available upon request to R. W. Williams or original data providers. 

<P>The majority of mouse genotypes in use after May 2005 are SNPs that were genotyped by the Jonathan Flint, Richard Mott (Wellcome Trust, Oxford), and Robert Williams.  DNA samples from more than ~480 strains of mice were genotyped at 15,360 SNPs at Illumina in early 2005. The entire set is referred to as the Wellcome-CTC SNP data set. The appropriate URL citation for these data is currently <A HREF="http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/mouse/INBREDS/" target="_blank" class="fs14">www.well.ox.ac.uk/mouse/INBREDS/</A>.

<P>The specific mouse genotype files used by WebQTL incorporated both SNPs and microsatellite have been substantially modified and error-checked and will not correspond precisely to the original Wellcome-CTC SNP data set files. All of these new markers are public and can be used. Please contact <A class="fs14" HREF="mailto:rwilliam@nb.utmem.edu">Rob Williams</A> if you would like the specific files used in any of the mouse genetic reference populations.

<A HREF="dbdoc/BXDPublish.html" target="_blank">Phenotypes</A> databases:

<P>Mouse phenotype databases were generated primarily by extracting trait values from the literature. All of the phenotype databases (BXD, AXB, CXB, BXH, LXS, LGXSM, HXB/BXH, and BayxSha) are curated by <A class="fs14" HREF="mailto:cheslerej@ornl.gov">Elissa Chesler</A> and Robert W. Williams. In several cases, these databases include extensive and still unpublished traits.

<B>Genomic and Array Annotation</B> databases:

<P>The GeneNetwork relies on custom and public databases for Affymetrix, Illumina, and Agilent array platforms. In the case of the mouse Affymetrix U74Av2 and M430 arrays, and the rat RAE230A array, we have extensively annotated probes and probe set data. Our files are manually curated and will NOT correspond 1-to-1 with any other publically available annotation of these particular Affymetrix platforms. In the case of mouse, we have data on the positions of a large number of SNPs. These data were contributed by a number of colleagues and integrated by Rob Williams, Rob Crowell, and colleagues. Please contact  <A class="fs14" HREF="mailto:rwilliam@nb.utmem.edu">Rob Williams</A> if you would like access to parts of this data set. Detailed SNP data have now been placed on WebQTL maps and we thank Celera for providing early access to these data in 2003.
