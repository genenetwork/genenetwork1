#### Running inside a Guix container

Running Genenetwork1 in modern environments can be difficult since its
dependencies are no longer actively supported. However, with guix, you
can reproduce the environment in which it ran. This is possible since
some of the old (deprecated) packages are either maintained in
[guix-past](https://gitlab.inria.fr/guix-hpc/guix-past) or
[guix-bioinformatics](http://git.genenetwork.org/guix-bioinformatics/guix-bioinformatics.git/).


To host genenetwork1 in a guix container, simply run:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# Modify paths accordingly; or if you have your channels configured
# appropriately, you don't need to include the "-L" flags

/path/to/pre-inst-env guix environment \
    -L /path/to/guix-past/modules/ \
    -L /path/to/guix-bioinformatics/ \
    --pure \
    genenetwork1 \
    --ad-hoc \
    httpd-with-mod-python \
    python2@2.4 \
    python24-htmlgen-GN1 \
    python24-json-GN1 \
    python24-mysqlclient \
    python24-numarray \
    python24-piddle \
    python24-pp-GN1 \
    python24-pyx \
    python24-pyxlwriter \
    python24-qtlreaper \
    python24-rpy2 \
    python24-svg-GN1 \
    -- \
    httpd \
    -f \
    $(/path/to/pre-inst-env guix build -L /path/to/guix-past/modules/ -L /path/to/guix-bioinformatics/ -e '(@ (gn services gn1-httpd-config) GN1-httpd-config)') \
    -T
```

This runs genenetwork1 on port 8042. To change the default port,
modify: GN1-httpd-config in
[gn1-httpd-config.scm](http://git.genenetwork.org/guix-bioinformatics/guix-bioinformatics/src/branch/master/gn/services/gn1-httpd-config.scm). Other
default params you can modify are:

- pid-file (default: "/tmp/guix-gn1/httpd-genenetwork1.pid")
- error-log (default: "/tmp/guix-gn1/httpd-genenetwork1-error-log")

Ensure the above files exist and your user can write to those
directories(i.e. /tmp/guix-gn1).

To kill the service on port 8042, get the id of the running httpd
process: `lsof -i :<portNumber>`, and then simply kill it. A one liner
looks like:

```sh
kill $(lsof -i :8042 | cut -d' ' -f2| sed -n 2p)
```

Logs are in: "/tmp/guix-gn1/httpd-genenetwork1-error-log".
